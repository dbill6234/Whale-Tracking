# Whale-Tracking
This project was designed to show the presence of a whale per sampling.  
The data was recorded from whale calls via hydrophone. The x-axis shows the number of samples sent out for a whale call.  The y-axis shows when a whale was detected based on their response.

thus indicating a whale present in the vicinity of the saildrone.
The data was taken from the kaggle sample files of whale calls vs non whale calls.

A sample file with a whale call is attached, along with a non whale call to distinguish the 2.
The train files (wav) will need to be downloaded to audacity to be able to listen to them.
