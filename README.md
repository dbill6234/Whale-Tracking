# Whale-Tracking
Codes, audio files
This project was designed to show the presence of a whale per sampling.  
The data was recorded from whale calls via hydrophone.  
The graph printed out on Jupyter notebook shows whn a whale answered the call, 
thus indicating a whale present in the vicinity of the saildrone.
The data was taken from the kaggle sample files of whale calls vs non whale calls.
A sample file with a whale call is attached, along with a non whale call to distinguish the 2.
The train files (wav) will need to be downloaded to audacity to be able to listen to them.
